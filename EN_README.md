# 🧩 PyLibKit Landing

**A macOS development kit for seamless Swift ↔ Python integration**

PyLibKit enables macOS developers to **run and manage Python code directly within Swift applications**.  
By bridging Python’s flexibility with Swift’s performance, PyLibKit empowers developers to build powerful hybrid macOS applications with minimal setup.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Native Python Runtime Integration**  
  Embed and execute a full Python interpreter inside Swift-based macOS apps  

- **Bridged Swift API**  
  Call Python functions directly from Swift and retrieve return values seamlessly  

- **Sandbox Compatibility**  
  Designed to operate safely under macOS sandbox environments  

- **Cross-Platform Roadmap**  
  Planned **iOS integration support**, leveraging Pyodide, embedded interpreters, or Swift-Python bridging techniques

## 🧠 Why PyLibKit?

Traditionally, integrating Python into macOS apps involves complex environment setup and path management.  
PyLibKit eliminates those headaches, allowing developers to **use Python’s power directly inside their Swift applications**.

> Run AI models, data processing, or automation scripts — all within a single app.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Run **Python-based AI/ML models** inside macOS applications  
- Use Python scripts for **data processing and automation**  
- Boost **developer productivity** through Swift-Python integration  
- Prototype **Python SDKs for iOS** (coming soon)
