**A cross-platform development kit for seamless Swift ↔ Python integration on iOS & macOS**

PyLibKit enables iOS and macOS developers to **run and manage Python code directly within Swift applications**.
By bridging Python's flexibility with Swift's performance, PyLibKit empowers developers to build powerful hybrid applications across all Apple platforms with minimal setup.

## 🚀 Features

- **Native Python Runtime Integration**  
  Embed and execute a full Python interpreter inside Swift-based macOS apps  

- **Bridged Swift API**  
  Call Python functions directly from Swift and retrieve return values seamlessly  

- **Sandbox Compatibility**  
  Designed to operate safely under macOS sandbox environments  

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  **Full iOS and macOS support** - Run Python on iPhone, iPad, and Mac with the same codebase

## 🧠 Why PyLibKit?

Traditionally, integrating Python into iOS and macOS apps involves complex environment setup and platform constraints.
PyLibKit eliminates those headaches, allowing developers to **use Python's power directly inside their Swift applications across all Apple platforms**.

> Run data processing, automation scripts, and web scraping — all within a single app.
